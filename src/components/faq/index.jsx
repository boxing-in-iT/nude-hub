            Everything is very simple - AI “finishes” the parts of the body
            covered by clothes by itself. Previously, the neural network trained
            on real photos with naked people, thereby training it.

          <p className="faq-answer">
            You simply upload a photo of a person on our site, launch his
            exposure and get a naked picture. First you need to log in to our
            web resource and select a tariff. In order to get the most realistic
            result, it is best to upload pictures in which people have a minimum
            of clothing. For example, when they are at the beach.

          <p className="faq-answer">
            To do this, you need to download photos from Instagram - for this
            you can use a special application in Google Chrome, for example, IG
            downloader. Install it and download photos from instagram in high
            quality, and then process it in the same way as all the others. Read
